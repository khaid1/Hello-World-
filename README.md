# Hello-World-
My first repository 
My name is khaid Hoilett a Economics and Finance student at the University of Guelph in Ontario Canada. I am entirely new to the world of developing and want to get started as quickly as possible. My ultimate goal is to be able to create my own iphone apps and feature applications for music production software such as ableton live (VST's).
